          <p>Isambard Kingdom Brunel is probably the best known British Engineer.
             Brunel lived during a period of great prosperity and optimism.  A period
             following on from the industrial revolution.  It was a period of great inovation
             and experimentation during the reign of Queen Victoria when the British
             Empire looked out on the world like a bright beacon.</p>
          <p>Brunel was involved in some of the most important engineering works during
             his time.  Today his most famous work, the Clifton Suspension Bridge,
             is still in daily use and is a testemony to the life and times of its chief
             engineer.</p>
          <p>Isambard Kingdom Brunel is a symbol of Great Britain at its best and most
             optimistic and a continuing inspiration to all young and aspiring engineers.</p>
